Blockchain technology was introduced in 2008 when Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin whitepaper, and, since then,
entrepreneurs and developers have attempted to generalize the technology to support a wider range of applications on a single blockchain platform.

While a number of blockchain platforms have struggled to support functional decentralized applications, application specific blockchains such as the BitShares decentralized exchange (2014) and Steem social media platform (2016) have become heavily used blockchains with tens of thousands of daily active users. They have achieved this by increasing performance to thousands of transactions per second, reducing latency to 1.5 seconds, eliminating per-transaction fees, and providing a user experience similar to those currently provided by existing centralized services.

Existing blockchain platforms are burdened by large fees and limited computational capacity that prevent widespread blockchain adoption. EOSIO is trying to solve this problem.
