If you do not want to install `EOSIO` binaries on your local machine, or if you have other types of restrictions installing `EOSIO` binaries, you can try `EOSIO` in a web browser. This approach is powered by Gitpod.io and Docker, and it provides developers with a personal single-node `EOSIO` blockchain for development and testing purposes running in Gitpod.io's cloud accessible from your web browser.

You can give it a try in a matter of seconds [right now](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-web-ide) and you can read more details about it [on the eosio-web-ide project page](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio-web-ide).
