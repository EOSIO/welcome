# Tic-tac-toe on EOSIO 
This tic-tac-toe tutorial guides you step by step to build a tic-tac-toe game which runs on an EOSIO blockchain. You will create a smart contract containing the game logic, then compile and deploy this smart contract to an EOSIO blockchain. In this tutorial we use a local [single node testnet](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/nodeos/usage/development-environment/local-single-node-testnet "local single node testnet") and show you how to play the game by calling the smart contract. 


[[info]]
| EOSIO is a blockchain software platform developed by Block.one. Smart contracts which run on the EOSIO platform should run on any blockchain which using the EOSIO platform. EOS is a digital token, though it also refers to the first public blockchain run on the EOSIO platform, EOS or the public mainnet. In this tutorial we will use the EOSIO platform to run a blockchain on your local machine. This runs only one producing node and is commonly called a single node testnet.


We explain the purpose of each step and why it is important.

## The Rules of the Game
The EOSIO tic-tac-toe rules are:

* Player one (the host) makes the first move, followed by player two (the challenger). 
* The first player to complete a row or diagonal of either X’s or O’s wins the game.
* If no player completes a row or diagonal of either X’s or O’s, the game is a draw. 

## Understanding the Game
The smart contract contains the game logic, therefore this section introduces how the game works and some of the EOSIO concepts needed to build a smart contract.

### The Game logic
The game is played by two players, so we need two blockchain accounts. This tutorial explains how to create and use these blockchain accounts on a local single node blockchain in the next step. Use these accounts to "push actions" to the blockchain. These actions start, restart, and close the game. Pushing a move action will place a 'marker' on the game 'board'.    

One player is the host, who starts the game, and one player is the challenger. The game board is nine squares, and each player takes a turn to place their marker in a square. A player wins the game when three markers are placed in a row.

In the example below the player who placed x has won.

| Row       | 0     | 1     | 2     |
| :-------: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|     0     |   -   |   o   |   x   |
|     1     |   -   |   x   |   -   |
|     2     |   x   |   o   |   o   |

When all the squares contain a marker and no player has three markers in a row, then the game is a draw.

### Accounts and Key Pairs
A blockchain account has a human readable name which is between 1 and 12 characters in length. Each account identifies a blockchain participant and the authority of that participant. Loading a smart contracts requires an account; an account can own one smart contract instance and a smart contract instance must be loaded by an account. Accounts are stored on the blockchain with their public keys. Each account requires at least one key pair (public and private keys.) The blockchain uses asymmetric cryptography to verify that the account pushing a transaction has signed the transaction with the matching private key. EOSIO blockchains use account authority tables to check that the account has the required authority to perform an action. For more information about accounts and permissions click on this link [Accounts and Permissions.](../60_protocol-guides/40_accounts_and_permissions.md)

### Smart Contract Actions
A smart contract exposes methods or ‘actions’ that transactions use to operate the game logic. Transactions may contain one or more ‘actions’. Transactions are generated dynamically outside the smart contract, within an application, or from the command line to call smart contract actions and execute business logic within a smart contract. Transactions are atomic. For example, if one action of a transaction fails the entire transaction fails and the blockchain state is restored to the original state. For more details about transactions and actions click on this link [Transactions Protocol.](../60_protocol-guides/20_transactions_protocol.md) You can use `cleos` to create transactions and push transactions to the blockchain. Transactions contain one or more actions. You can also use `cleos` to call actions directly. Actions can call other actions and can also call actions from other smart contracts.

![Transactions and Actions](images/tictactoe/transactions-and-actions-temp.png "Transactions and Actions")

### EOSIO Resources 
The EOSIO blockchain accounts own and consume three resources. By default a single node testnet does load the smart contract which tracks resources therefore this section is for information only:

* RAM - This resource is the amount of RAM available to an account. RAM stores smart contracts loaded on the blockchain. Smart contacts use RAM via the multi-index table to store smart contract state. Spend tokens to purchase more RAM, RAM can be sold.
* CPU - This resource is the amount of CPU which can be used by an account in each 24 hour period. Transactions consume CPU. Stake tokens for more CPU. Unstaking returns CPU. 
* NET - This resource is the amount of data which can be written to blockchain blocks by an account in each 24 hour period. The blockchain blocks store transactions and transaction parameters, the history of blockchain . Stake tokens for more NET. Unstaking returns NET.

For more information click on this link [Core Concepts](../20_introduction-to-eosio/20_core_concepts.md)

## Create Accounts and Key Pairs
The game requires at least two blockchain accounts, one for each player. The tutorial also creates a blockchain account to load the smart contract. 

### Run a local single node testnet
Run [nodeos](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/nodeos/index) locally to start a blockchain running on a single node. [Configure nodeos](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/nodeos/usage/nodeos-configuration) with [plugins](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/nodeos/plugins/index) to produce blocks, store a history of the blockchain in memory, provide HTTP RPC access to these plugins and to output running information to a file.

```shell
nodeos -e -p eosio --plugin eosio::producer_plugin --plugin eosio::producer_api_plugin --plugin eosio::chain_api_plugin --plugin eosio::http_plugin --plugin eosio::history_plugin --plugin eosio::history_api_plugin --filter-on="*" --access-control-allow-origin='*' --contracts-console --http-validate-host=false --verbose-http-errors >> nodeos.log 2>&1 &
```
Look at the `nodeos.log` file to ensure `nodeos` is running and producing blocks. The ouput should look as follows:

```console

### Procedure for Accounts
1. Create a wallet - [How To Create A Wallet](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/cleos/how-to-guides/how-to-create-a-wallet)
2. Create key pair - [How To Create Key Pairs](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/cleos/how-to-guides/how-to-create-key-pairs)
3. Create the account - [How To Create An Account](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/cleos/how-to-guides/how-to-create-an-account#gatsby-focus-wrapper)
4. Import the account private key to the wallet - [How To Import A Key](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/cleos/how-to-guides/how-to-import-a-key)

For this tutorial we need to create two player accounts and an account for the smart contract
1. The host - the host will load the smart contract.
2. The challenger - the challenger will play the game with the host.
3. The tictactoe account - the smart contract is loaded to this account.

#### Cleos Commands
To use the command line to create the accounts run the following commands. Make sure that the local wallet is [open](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/cleos/command-reference/wallet/open) and [unlocked](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/cleos/command-reference/wallet/unlock) and run these commands to create the accounts with the private keys stored in the local wallet.

Create a wallet called 'local'.

```shell
cleos wallet create --name local --to-console
```

This command outputs to stdout
```console
Creating wallet: local
Save password to use in the future to unlock this wallet.
Without password imported keys will not be retrievable.
"PW5K8dtLxB8q56JbT8UA5FQyDykNT24LS6i6gcBuxbYSixFgEpFa7"
```

Save the password, you will need this to unlock the wallet later.

To check the wallet run
```shell 
cleos wallet list
```

The output shows two wallets, one for each version of this tutorial, and * shows that the local wallet is unlocked.
```console
Wallets:
[
  "local *",
  "testnet"
]
```

[[info]]
| Account creation requires a creator account; every new blockchain is created with an account called "eosio". The "eosio" account is a special account that can be used to bootstrap a blockchain, click the following link for more information about [bootstrapping a blockchain for real world use.](10_bios-boot-sequence.md) In a production blockchain the eosio account keys are [resigned](10_bios-boot-sequence.md#3-resign-eosio-account-and-system-accounts).  To use our local single node testnet we need to add the private key of the eosio account to our wallet so that we can create other accounts. **The private key is well known and so any blockchain where the eosio acount has not been resigned is not secure.**


[[info]]
| The eosio private key is **5KQwrPbwdL6PhXujxW37FSSQZ1JiwsST4cqQzDeyXtP79zkvFD3**

#### Import the eosio private key
```shell
cleos wallet import --name local 5KQwrPbwdL6PhXujxW37FSSQZ1JiwsST4cqQzDeyXtP79zkvFD3
``` 

Create three key pairs, one for the smart contract, and two separate accounts for the host and the challenger.

```shell
cleos create key --to-console
```
```console
Private key: 5JyC1kXq3WSpsyBc7rYpkBQBSc9GjLvVQ2QHFnS1iojiYNmKifX
Public key: EOS7RGhr3mEvHm66Rter6vj8ZSGJ1uV8wZSEUuaeRj1Ywvi9YqFZn
```
```shell
cleos create key --to-console
```
```console
Private key: 5JSRUrUVbRsV2yJ2XSMtRtPzQ5UKbSYEGEjdKfGMS1xsvRZj7FH
Public key: EOS5p55prHwrN6KosqF4NdRayVW2mqwA8RGNEbaZXRBs2SQHwBWSf
```
```shell
cleos create key --to-console
```
```console
Private key: 5JReVMTiiztAUyQGp9w7BMMm1HVUurDmEKuSL53DQww3JKVZjot
Public key: EOS7qkiVnptc8wbHzHPC9jj1YECKJgQeUktBTm8RDA64oH3e75QW5
```

Create the tictactoe smart contract account.  
```shell
cleos create account eosio tictactoe EOS7RGhr3mEvHm66Rter6vj8ZSGJ1uV8wZSEUuaeRj1Ywvi9YqFZn
```

Import the matching private key to the local wallet
```shell
cleos wallet import --name local --private-key 5JyC1kXq3WSpsyBc7rYpkBQBSc9GjLvVQ2QHFnS1iojiYNmKifX
```

Create the host account.  
```shell
cleos create account eosio host EOS5p55prHwrN6KosqF4NdRayVW2mqwA8RGNEbaZXRBs2SQHwBWSf
```

Import the matching private key to the local wallet
```shell
cleos wallet import --name local --private-key 5JSRUrUVbRsV2yJ2XSMtRtPzQ5UKbSYEGEjdKfGMS1xsvRZj7FH
```

Create the challenger account and import a private key into the local wallet. 
```shell
cleos create account eosio challenger EOS7qkiVnptc8wbHzHPC9jj1YECKJgQeUktBTm8RDA64oH3e75QW5
```

Import the matching private key to the local wallet
```shell
cleos wallet import --name local --private-key 5JReVMTiiztAUyQGp9w7BMMm1HVUurDmEKuSL53DQww3JKVZjot
```

[[warning | Keep your keys safe]]
| Use a wallet to securely store private keys. Keep your private keys private and do not share your private keys with anyone. A private key provides full access to a blockchain account.

## Tic-tac-toe Smart Contract
Once you have your eosio accounts you can create the smart contract. Use your favorite text editor of IDE to create the .hpp and .cpp files.

### Smart Contract Requirements
The tictactoe.hpp file (or header file) contains the declarations of the smart contract. Declarations inform the smart contract compiler what data structures to use in the smart contract to represent the game board and track game play. The header file also declares the smart contract actions that operate the game.

The tictactoe.cpp file contains implementations of the smart contract actions declared in the tictactoe.hpp header file and uses the data structures declared in the header file.

The “Compile and deploy the smart contract to the blockchain” section details compilation of the files. The compiler is the `eosio-cpp` tool from the EOSIO.CDT. Click on this link for more information on the [EOSIO.CDT.](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.cdt/latest/index "EOSIO.CDT documentation") The EOSIO.CDT builds the smart contract and creates an `ABI` file. Click on this link for more information about [ABI Files.](../40_smart-contract-guides/30_understanding-ABI-files.md)

### Game Board Representation
A `std::vector` represents the tic-tac-toe board. The number 0 marks an empty square. The number 1 denotes a movement by the host. The number 2 denotes a movement by the challenger. To make a movement, you push a transaction to the tic-tac-toe smart contract.

Logically the board looks like:

| Row       | 0     | 1     | 2     |
| :-------: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|     0     |   -   |   -   |   -   |
|     1     |   -   |   -   |   -   |
|     2     |   -   |   -   |   -   |

This board is represented as a `std::vector` of integers with the positions in the following order:
 
[0,0] [0,1] [0,2] [1,0] [1,1] [1,2] [2,0] [2,1] [2,2]

For example, in the above game board illustration 

* An empty board is represented as [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
* The host takes the first move and marks their square with an X in row 0, column 2, which results in an array represented as [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
* The challenger takes the next move and marks their square with an O in row 0, column 1 which results in an array represented as [0, 2, 1, 0,  0, 0, 0, 0, 0].

At the end of a drawn game, the board array may be  represented as [1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1] 

Array Representation

| Row       | 0     | 1     | 2     |
| :-------: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|     0     |   1   |   2   |   1   |
|     1     |   1   |   2   |   2   |
|     2     |   2   |   1   |   1   |

Game Representation

| Row       | 0     | 1     | 2     |
| :-------: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|     0     |   x   |   o   |   x   |
|     1     |   x   |   o   |   o   |
|     2     |   o   |   x   |   x   |

### Create tictactoe.hpp file
This section creates the tictactoe.hpp file. This header file contains the declarations of the tictactoe class, the definitions of tictactoe game data structures, and the declarations of tictactoe game methods, known as actions in EOSIO smart contracts.


#### Game Data Structures
The tic-tac-toe smart contract hpp file defines the following public data structures to store game information.  

* game - The game data structure contains game data. The structure has variables of type `eosio::name`, for challenger, host, turn and winner. Click on this link for a definition of [eosio::name](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.cdt/latest/structeosio_1_1name "eosio.cdt reference - name structure") . The structure has a `std::vector` representing the game board  
* Games - Games is a type definition that uses a class template. Games uses an `eosio::muti_index` template to define a type which stores a game structure in RAM. Click on this link for more information on [eosio::multi_index](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.cdt/latest/group__multiindex "eosio.cdt reference - multi index table") and click on this link for more general information about [multi index tables.](../40_smart-contract-guides/40_data-persistence.md) 

#### Game Actions
The tic-tac-toe smart contract .hpp file defines the following four public actions to operate the game logic.  

* create - This action launches a new game and creates a new game board array. The host may use this command.
* restart - This action clears data from an existing game board array. The host or the challenger may use this command.
* close - This action deletes and removes existing game data and frees up any storage the game uses. No game data persists. The host may use this command.
* move - This action sets a marker on the gameboard and updates the game board array. The host or the challenger may use this command.

#### Procedure for tictactoe.hpp file
Complete the following steps to create the tictactoe.hpp file:

1. Create a tictactoe folder on your local drive containing tictactoe.hpp
2. Import the eosio base library.
   Add this code to the .hpp file:

```c++
// 5. Import the eosio base library.
#include <eosio/eosio.hpp>
```

3. For convenience use the `eosio` namespace.
   Add this code to the .hpp file:

```c++
//6. use the eosio namespace
using namespace eosio;
```

4. Declare the class.
5. Use the `[[eosio::contract(contract_name)]]` attribute lets compiler know this is a smart contract and that the compiler should generate the main dispatcher and the `ABI`. Click on this link for more information on [generator attributes.](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.cdt/latest/best-practices/abi/abi-code-generator-attributes-explained) 
6. Inherit from the `eosio::contract` public base class.
7. Introduce base class members.
8. Use the base class constructor.
    
	Add this code to the .hpp file:

```c++
// 7. Declare the class. 8. Use the [[eosio::contract(contract_name)]] attribute. 9. Inherit from the base class. 
class[[eosio::contract("tictactoe")]] tictactoe : public contract
{
public:
    
    // 10 Introduce base class members. 
    using contract::contract;
    
    // 11. Use the base class constructor.
    tictactoe(name receiver, name code, datastream<const char *> ds) : contract(receiver, code, ds) {}
};
```
9. Declare game data structure and use the `[[eosio::table]]` attribute to let the compiler know this uses a multi index table. Click on this link for more information on [generator attributes.](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.cdt/latest/best-practices/abi/abi-code-generator-attributes-explained) Click on this link for more information about [Multi Index Table](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.cdt/latest/group__multiindex)
10. Create a **primary_key** method. This is automatically used as an index for the table.
11. Use the `EOSLIB_SERIALIZE` macro to define how the data is serialized / deserialized in and out of the multi index table.  Click on this link for more information about [EOSLIB_SERIALIZE](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.cdt/latest/group__serialize)

    Add this code to the .hpp file inside the public section of the class:

```c++
    // 12. Declare game data structure.
    struct [[eosio::table]] game
    {
        static constexpr uint16_t boardWidth = 3;
        static constexpr uint16_t boardHeight = boardWidth;
        
        game() : board(boardWidth * boardHeight, 0){}

        name challenger, host, turn; // = account name of host, challenger and turn to store whose turn it is.
        name winner = none; // = none/ draw/ name of host/ name of challenger

        std::vector<uint8_t> board;

        // Initialize the board with empty cell
        void initializeBoard(){
            board.assign(boardWidth * boardHeight, 0);
        }

        // Reset game
        void resetGame(){
            initializeBoard();
            turn = host;
            winner = "none"_n;
        }

        // 13. primary key accessor
		auto primary_key() const { return challenger.value; }

        //14. EOSLIB_SERIALIZE macro defining how the abi serializes / deserializes  
		EOSLIB_SERIALIZE( game, (challenger)(host)(turn)(winner)(board))
    };
```

12. Define the games type which uses the game data structure with the multi-index table template. Click on this link for more information about the multi-index table template used to define multi index table types [function multi_index.](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.cdt/latest/group__multiindex#function-multi_index) Set the name to "games" and use the [eosio::name](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.cdt/latest/structeosio_1_1name#struct-eosioname) operator [_n](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.cdt/latest/name_8hpp#function-operator_n) to construct an [eosio::name](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.cdt/latest/structeosio_1_1name) with a string. The value is stored as a `uint64_t`. 
    
	Add this code to the .hpp file inside the public section of the class, after the declaration of the game structure:

```c++
    // 15. Define the game data structure using the multi-index table template.
    typedef eosio::multi_index<"games"_n, game> games;
```

13. Declare class methods and use the `[[eosio::action]]` attribute to let the compiler know this is a smart contract action. Click on this link for more information on [generator attributes.](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.cdt/latest/best-practices/abi/abi-code-generator-attributes-explained) 
    
	Add this code to the .hpp file inside the public section of the class:

```c++
    [[eosio::action]]
    void create(const name &challenger, name &host);
    
    [[eosio::action]]
    void restart(const name &challenger, const name &host, const name &by);

    [[eosio::action]]
    void close(const name &challenger, const name &host);
    
    [[eosio::action]]   
    void move(const name &challenger, const name &host, const name &by, const uint16_t &row, const uint16_t &column);
```

14. The move action uses the following private supporting methods to determine if a move is valid. They also check for a winning move:
    * isEmptyCell
    * isValidMove
    * getWinner
    
	Add this code to the .hpp file inside a private section of the class:

```c++
    bool isEmptyCell(const uint8_t &cell);
    bool isValidMove(const uint16_t &row, const uint16_t &column, const std::vector<uint8_t> &board);
    name getWinner(const game &currentGame);
```

### Create tictactoe.cpp file
This section creates the tictactoe.cpp file. This file contains the implementations of the tic-tac-toe smart contract actions and the private methods used by the smart contract actions, based the declarations in the header file.

#### Procedure for tictactoe.cpp file
Complete the following steps to create the tictactoe.cpp file:

1. Create a tictactoe.cpp file in the tictactoe folder. 
2. Import the tictactoe.hpp file and make the tictactoe definitions from the previous section available.
   Add this code to the .cpp file: 

```c++
#include "tictactoe.hpp"
```
3. Implement create.
   * Ensure that the action has the signature from the host
   * Ensure that the challenger and host are not the same player
   * Ensure that there is no existing game
   * Store the newly created game to the multi index table

   Add this code to the .cpp file:

```c++
void tictactoe::create(const name &challenger, name &host) {
    require_auth(host);
    check(challenger != host, "Challenger should not be the same as the host.");

    // Check if game already exists
    games existingHostGames(get_self(), host.value);
    auto itr = existingHostGames.find(challenger.value);
    check(itr == existingHostGames.end(), "Game already exists.");

    existingHostGames.emplace(host, [&](auto &g) {
        g.challenger = challenger;
        g.host = host;
        g.turn = host;
    });
}
```

4. Implement restart.
   * Ensure that the action has the signature from the host/challenger
   * Ensure that the game exists
   * Ensure that the restart action is done by host/challenger
   * Reset the game
   * Store the updated game to the multi index table

   Add this code to the .cpp file:

```c++
void tictactoe::restart(const name &challenger, const name &host, const name &by){
    check(has_auth(by), "Only " + by.to_string() + "can restart the game.");

    // Check if game exists
    games existingHostGames(get_self(), host.value);
    auto itr = existingHostGames.find(challenger.value);
    check(itr != existingHostGames.end(), "Game does not exist.");

    // Check if this game belongs to the action sender
    check(by == itr->host || by == itr->challenger, "This is not your game.");

    // Reset game
    existingHostGames.modify(itr, itr->host, [](auto &g) {
        g.resetGame();
    });
}
```

5. Implement close.
   * Ensure that the action has the signature from the host
   * Ensure that the game exists
   * Remove the game from the db

   Add this code to the .cpp file:

```c++
void tictactoe::close(const name &challenger, const name &host){
    check(has_auth(host), "Only the host can close the game.");

    require_auth(host);

    // Check if game exists
    games existingHostGames(get_self(), host.value);
    auto itr = existingHostGames.find(challenger.value);
    check(itr != existingHostGames.end(), "Game does not exist.");

    // Remove game
    existingHostGames.erase(itr);
}
```

6. Implement move supporting methods.
   * Implement isEmptyCell.

   Add this code to the .cpp file:

```c++
bool tictactoe::isEmptyCell(const uint8_t &cell){
    return cell == 0;
}
``` 
   * Implement isValidMove.

   Add this code to the .cpp file:

```c++
bool tictactoe::isValidMove(const uint16_t &row, const uint16_t &column, const std::vector<uint8_t> &board){
    uint32_t movementLocation = row * game::boardWidth + column;
    bool isValid = movementLocation < board.size() && isEmptyCell(board[movementLocation]);
    return isValid;
}
```
   * Implement getWinner. The winner is the first player who places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

   Add this code to the .cpp file:

```c++
name tictactoe::getWinner(const game &currentGame)
{
    auto &board = currentGame.board;

    bool isBoardFull = true;

    // Use bitwise AND operator to determine the consecutive values of each column, row and diagonal
    // Since 3 == 0b11, 2 == 0b10, 1 = 0b01, 0 = 0b00
    std::vector<uint32_t> consecutiveColumn(game::boardWidth, 3);
    std::vector<uint32_t> consecutiveRow(game::boardHeight, 3);
    uint32_t consecutiveDiagonalBackslash = 3;
    uint32_t consecutiveDiagonalSlash = 3;

    for (uint32_t i = 0; i < board.size(); i++)
    {
        isBoardFull &= isEmptyCell(board[i]);
        uint16_t row = uint16_t(i / game::boardWidth);
        uint16_t column = uint16_t(i % game::boardWidth);

        // Calculate consecutive row and column value
        consecutiveRow[column] = consecutiveRow[column] & board[i];
        consecutiveColumn[row] = consecutiveColumn[row] & board[i];
        // Calculate consecutive diagonal \ value
        if (row == column)
        {
            consecutiveDiagonalBackslash = consecutiveDiagonalBackslash & board[i];
        }
        // Calculate consecutive diagonal / value
        if (row + column == game::boardWidth - 1)
        {
            consecutiveDiagonalSlash = consecutiveDiagonalSlash & board[i];
        }
    }

    // Inspect the value of all consecutive row, column, and diagonal and determine winner
    std::vector<uint32_t> aggregate = {consecutiveDiagonalBackslash, consecutiveDiagonalSlash};
    aggregate.insert(aggregate.end(), consecutiveColumn.begin(), consecutiveColumn.end());
    aggregate.insert(aggregate.end(), consecutiveRow.begin(), consecutiveRow.end());

    for (auto value : aggregate)
    {
        if (value == 1)
        {
            return currentGame.host;
        }
        else if (value == 2)
        {
            return currentGame.challenger;
        }
    }
    // Draw if the board is full, otherwise the winner is not determined yet
    return isBoardFull ? draw : none;
}
```

7. Implement move.
   * Ensure that the action has the signature from the host/ challenger
   * Ensure that the game exists
   * Ensure that the game is not finished yet
   * Ensure that the move action is done by host or challenger
   * Ensure that this is the right user's turn
   * Verify movement is valid 
   * Update board with the new move
   * Change the move_turn to the other player
   * Determine if there is a winner
   * Store the updated game to the multi index table

   Add this code to the .cpp file:

```c++
void tictactoe::move(const name &challenger, const name &host, const name &by, const uint16_t &row, const uint16_t &column){
    check(has_auth(by), "The next move should be made by " + by.to_string());

    // Check if game exists
    games existingHostGames(get_self(), host.value);
    auto itr = existingHostGames.find(challenger.value);
    check(itr != existingHostGames.end(), "Game does not exist.");

    // Check if this game hasn't ended yet
    check(itr->winner == none, "The game has ended.");
    
    // Check if this game belongs to the action sender
    check(by == itr->host || by == itr->challenger, "This is not your game.");
    // Check if this is the  action sender's turn
    check(by == itr->turn, "it's not your turn yet!");

    // Check if user makes a valid movement
    check(isValidMove(row, column, itr->board), "Not a valid movement.");

    // Fill the cell, 1 for host, 2 for challenger
    //TODO could use constant for 1 and 2 as well
    const uint8_t cellValue = itr->turn == itr->host ? 1 : 2;
    const auto turn = itr->turn == itr->host ? itr->challenger : itr->host;
    existingHostGames.modify(itr, itr->host, [&](auto &g) {
        g.board[row * game::boardWidth + column] = cellValue;
        g.turn = turn;
        g.winner = getWinner(g);
    });
}
```

## Compile and Deploy
To deploy the smart contract to the blockchain first use the EOSIO.CDT (EOSIO Contract Development Toolkit) `eosio-cpp` tool to build the `.wasm` file and a corresponding `.abi` file. Click on this link for details on [eosio-cpp tool](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.cdt/latest/command-reference/eosio-cpp "eosio-cdt reference eosio-cpp tool") and click on this link for details about the [EOSIO.CDT](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.cdt/latest/index "Contract Development Toolkit")

The `.wasm` file (or webassembly) is the binary code that the `wasm engine` in the blockchain executes. The webassembly engine currently used in eosio is [eos-vm](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos-vm "git eos-vm"). The application binary interface or `.abi` file defines how to pack and unpack the data used by a smart contract, see [Understanding ABI Files.](../40_smart-contract-guides/30_understanding-ABI-files.md) for more information.     

### Compilation
To compile the smart contract change to the tictactoe folder  and run `eosio-cpp`. Click on this link for more information about using the [eosio-cpp tool](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eosio.cdt/latest/command-reference/eosio-cpp "eosio-cpp command reference") .

```shell
tictactoe$ eosio-cpp tictactoe.cpp
```

The output from this command is:

```console
Warning, empty ricardian clause file
Warning, empty ricardian clause file
Warning, action <create> does not have a ricardian contract
Warning, action <restart> does not have a ricardian contract
Warning, action <close> does not have a ricardian contract
Warning, action <move> does not have a ricardian contract
```

For this tutorial we ignore these warnings. Click on the following link for a tutorial showing how to add the optional ricardian contracts [Prepare the Ricardian Contract](../40_smart-contract-guides/40_data-persistence.md#step-10-prepare-the-ricardian-contract-optional "Getting Started - Data Peristence")


The tictactoe directory now contains two new files, `tictactoe.wasm` and `tictactoe.abi`.

### Deploy the Single Node Testnet
[Deploy the smart contract](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/cleos/how-to-guides/how-to-deploy-a-smart-contract) on the single node testnet tictactoe account with the following command.

In the same directory as the generated `wasm` and `ABI` files run
```shell
cleos set contract tictactoe ./ tictactoe.wasm tictactoe.abi -p tictactoe@active
```

## Play The Game
Now that the smart contract has been successfully deployed [push smart contract actions](https://developers.eos.io/manuals/eos/latest/cleos/command-reference/push/push-action) to the blockchain to play the game.  


### Create a Game
A game requires a host and a challenger. Use the accounts created earlier in the [Create the necessary accounts and key pairs](#create-accounts-and-key-pairs) section of the tutorial for these. These accounts can use arbitrary names. In this example assume the host has the account name of `host` and the challenger has the account name of `challenger`.

The create action takes two parameters, the "challenger" and the "host". The required payload in `json` format is:

```json
{
  "challenger": "challenger",
  "host": "host"
}
```

Sign the push action with `host@active`, the host of the game.

```shell
cleos push action tictactoe create '{"challenger":"challenger", "host":"host"}' --permission host@active
```

### Making Game Moves
Players make moves in turn by pushing ‘move’ actions to the blockchain. The host moves first, and each move must be signed by the appropriate account.

The move action takes five parameters, the "challenger", the "host", the player who makes the move or "by" and "row" and "column" parameters to show where the marker is placed.

The host makes the first move. The required payload in `json` format is:

```json
{
  "challenger": "challenger",
  "host": "host",
  "by": "host",
  "row": 0,
  "column": 1
}
```

Sign the push action with `host@active` - the host of the game.

```shell
cleos push action tictactoe move '{"challenger":"challenger", "host":"host", "by":"host", "row":0, "column":1}' --permission host@active
```

The challenger makes the second move. The required payload in `json` format is:

```json
{
  "challenger": "challenger",
  "host": "host",
  "by": "challenger",
  "row": 1,
  "column": 1
}
```

Sign the push action with `challenger@active` - the challenger.

```shell
cleos push action tictactoe move '{"challenger":"challenger", "host":"host", "by":"challenger", "row":1, "column":1}' --permission challenger@active
```

Continue to make moves until the game ends with a win or a draw.

### Check Game Status 
Look at the data in the multi index table to check the game status. 

```shell
cleos get table tictactoe host games
```

### Restart the Game
The restart action takes three parameters, the "challenger", the "host", and "by". The required payload in `json` format is:

```json
{
  "challenger": "challenger",
  "host": "host",
  "by": "host"
}
```

Sign the push action with `host@active` - the host of the game.

```shell
cleos push action tictactoe restart '{"challenger":"challenger", "host":"host", "by":"host"}' --permission host@active
```

Check the game status to see that the board has been reset.

```shell
cleos get table tictactoe host games
```

### Close the Game
The close action takes two parameters, the "challenger" and the "host". The required payload in `json` format is:

```json
{
  "challenger": "challenger",
  "host": "host"
}
```

Sign the push action with ‘host@active’ - the host of the game.

```shell
cleos push action tictactoe close '{"challenger":"challenger", "host":"host"}' --permission host@active
```

Check the game status to see that game data has been removed.  

```shell
cleos get table tictactoe host games
```
