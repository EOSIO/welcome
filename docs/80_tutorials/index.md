## Before you begin
To get started as quickly as possible we recommend using pre-built binaries. Building from source is a more advanced option but will set you back an hour or more and you may encounter build errors. See the [Getting Started Guide](../30_getting-started-guide) for details on how to install and set up the required EOSIO components.

1. [BIOS Boot Sequence](10_bios-boot-sequence.md): Demonstrates how to bootstrap a new EOSIO blockchain.
2. Tic-tac-toe Game Contract: Build a simple tic-tac-toe game on EOSIO to apply the knowledge you acquired earlier. Two versions are available:
   - [Tic-tac-toe using local single node](20_tic-tac-toe-game-smart-contract-single-node.md)
   - [Tic-tac-toe using remote testnet](21_tic-tac-toe-game-smart-contract-Testnet.md)
3. [Elemental Battles](https://battles.eos.io?utm_source=devportal): Created for developers new to blockchain, Elemental Battles is part-tutorial, part-game development. You’ll play in a fantasy world and harness the powers of wood, water, and fire to learn blockchain basics and build your first game on EOSIO.
